# Yolov8_Driving_Assistant
- A YOLOv8 object detection model is used to identify and annotate detected objects such as cars, pedestrians, trucks, and cyclists in the videos. It utilizes OpenAIâ€™s GPT model to generate emergency alerts and descriptions based on detected objects in each frame. The output is an annotated video that visually conveys important information to drivers.
